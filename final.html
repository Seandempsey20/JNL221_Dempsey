			<h2> Performance Enhancing Drugs lead NFL Suspensions Over The Past 40 Years</h2>
			<h4> Suspensions in the National Football League have taken off in the past 20 years and PEDs are a big reason for that. However, the way suspensions are given out are still inconsistent.<br>By Sean Dempsey</br> </h4>

			<h3>How Far The NFL Has Come</h3>
			<p>The National Football League was founded in 1920, but it wasn’t until the 1960s that the NFL started to innovate and gain popularity. For context, the first Super Bowl was played in 1967 and the NFL Draft started to become more popular amongst fans following their teams around that time as well. Players and big-time personalities joining the league lead to more attention to the NFL and an increase in revenue. In the 1970s players started being paid more than ever and competition within the NFL rose to new heights. This is where things started to take a turn for the worse. Players began taking pills and using illegal substances to play better to win and earn larger salaries. In the 1980s, steroid, marijuana, and substance abuse usage increased across the league and the NFL didn’t start cracking down until the early 2000s.</p>

			<h3>Performance Enhancing Drugs Have Taken The League By Storm</h3>

			<p>From the data set below it can be seen that performing enhancing substances (PEDs) have been the most common way for a player to be suspended from the NFL over the past 50 years. PEDs are used to improve any form of activity or performance in humans, so it only makes sense that an athlete would want to take them. They build and strengthen muscles, while also reducing recovery time and body fat. Out of 269 suspensions in the National Football League since 1946, 134 of them have been performing enhancing drug related. That amounts to 50% of total suspensions being because of steroids. ***** NEED A QUOTE***** Personal conduct is the second leading cause for suspension. 23% of all suspensions since 1946 have been related to personal conduct. According to the NFL, this can be assault, domestic violence, sexual assault, and battery.</p>

			<p>The NFL team with the most total suspensions and PED suspensions is the Broncos. As seen from the chart Denver has 11 performance-enhancing drug suspensions. Most people may think that the Broncos would have its suspensions mostly because of marijuana usage because its legal in Colorado, but that simply isn’t the case. What is interesting however is that despite the increase in PED usage from the Broncos, the team has only won 2 Super Bowls between 1960 and 2014. Therefore, there isn’t a complete correlation between PED usage and PED suspensions with winning in the NFL. Since the early 2000s, the NFL has started to crack down on PEDs and drug usage to make the game more fair for everyone. From 2006 to 2014 there were double-digit. To put this in perspective, there wasn’t a single-player suspension from 1963 to 1983.

			<p>This is because it was known that players were using steroids to become stronger and faster and the league didn’t see anything wrong with it until it put players a serious advantage over others who weren’t “juicing”. In fact, 85% of the NFL’s total suspensions whether it be from PEDs, regular drug use, or domestic violence have come after the year 2000. Why is this? Well, at the time the NFL was only worried about what would bring in revenue and viewership. For them that was players and personalities that people would enjoy watching. Nowadays, the National Football League is primarily focused on its image, player safety, and fair play. </p>

			<h3>The NFL is Still Inconsistent With How They Give Out Suspensions</h3>
			<p>It’s also no secret that players in the NFL not only use PEDs but other drugs like marijuana to ease pain. Marijuana suspensions like PEDs are inconsistent and have depended on the player and time period. One of the greatest wide receivers of all time, Calvin Johnson, reportedly used to smoke pot while he was in the league and was never caught. “Megatron revealed that he smoked marijuana after nearly every game he played in from 2007 until his retirement in 2015. He used the drug to help ease the physical pain that he would feel after each game, and he also used it because he was alarmed by the rampant opioid abuse,” John Breech stated in a CBS Sports article. One could speculate that Calvin Johnson not being suspended was because he was one of the most popular players in the NFL leading all receivers in jersey sales that year. Players now can no longer be suspended for testing positive for marijuana, but it highlights how inconsistent the NFL is with PED and suspensions related to pot. Performance-enhancing drugs have changed the league forever and are the leading cause of suspensions in the NFL.</p>
			<p>Over the course of time, the total number of suspensions especially with PEDs has increased dramatically over the past 20 years because of the NFL’s transition to a more fair game. However, there are still loopholes like with Calvin Johnson that suggest that the National Football League’s suspension policy still has some flaws.</p>
